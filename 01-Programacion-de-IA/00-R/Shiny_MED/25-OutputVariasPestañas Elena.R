"This example demonstrates the tabsetPanel and tabPanel widgets.

Notice that outputs that are not visible are not re-evaluated until they become visible. 
Try this:

Scroll to the bottom of the server function. You might need to use 
the show with app option so you can easily view the code and interact with 
the app at the same time.

Change the number of observations, and observe that only output$plot is evaluated.

Click the Summary tab, and observe that output$summary is evaluated.

Change the number of observations again, and observe that now only 
output$summary is evaluated.
